"""
This is a simple program that asks for the users name.
Nothing more should really be added here other than what is already here.
"""
name = input("What is your name?") #Here, the variables name is "name", it asks the user for an input with a question, which is "What is your name?"
print("Hi",name)#Now here, it prints the users inputted name, greeting them and saying their name before ending the code.
